replay encounter analysis:
- tether & debuff passing range
- pull range

network:
- hook send/recv (a-la xivalexander)
- store raw packets, create visualizer
- auto detect new opcodes for known packets based on size
- allow injecting custom client messages in next sent bundle (or just create new bundle?..)

boss modules:
- draw actors by framework (components should return color+prio)
- assignments and sharing (webservice?)
- targeting should take hitbox into account (0.5 for players) - cones, circles, rects...
- p3s - review, searing breeze component

autorotation:
- war
-- low-level rotation - improve berserk delay logic, berserk buff id
-- automatic bloodwhetting?
-- charge planning
-- offensive CD planning/delay
- whm:
-- glare - low-level status ids
-- auto assize
-- asylum/liturgy queue

cooldown planner:
- select columns to show (concrete actions, categories)
- plan tankswaps
- plan raid cooldowns (think about ui and storage for that...)
- build state-id => metrics (delay-to-planned action, delay-to-positioning/downtime) map instead of doing calculations every frame

world rendering:
- danger zones (modify action vfx?)
- arrows

misc:
- memory show/watch utility
- clip circles to arena bounds...
- fix clipping/triangulation bugs
- reconsider worldstate->bossmodule event subscription model (tedious to manually subscribe/unsubsribe and forward to components...)
- fail log?
- determine exact mechanism for cooldown reset (on instance enter and on wipe)
- data driven boss modules?.. would enable sequence autorecord and live editing - or is it covered by replay analysis?
- draw target max-melee and boss positioning hints?..
- action not learned = GetActionStatus -> 573 (this is rowid of LogMessage "action not yet learned") => can be used to disable non-learned spells

notes on targeting:
- aoe (e.g. cone) will hit if shape intersects target's hitbox; for players it is == 0.5
- max melee range is raw range (usually 3) + source hitbox radius + target hitbox radius; for players this usually means 3.5 + target hitbox
- charge/onslaught will bring player to source hitbox radius + target hitbox radius range, or leave in place if current distance is less
