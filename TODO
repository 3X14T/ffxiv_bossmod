autorotation v2:
- auto start/end logic
-- on countdown start => plan (should be automatic), or user-configured default preset
-- on countdown end, if not in combat => abort
-- on combat start, if countdown above threshold => abort (ninjapull)
-- on combat start, otherwise => n/a (continue)
-- on combat start, if inactive (no countdown) => n/a (stay idle, ninjapull or smth...)
-- on combat end => abort
-- timeout => move to idle
-- die => ??? abort probably...
-- introduce 'force disabled' state (after abort, until combat ends + countdown is inactive, prevents any autorotation running)
- revise planner
- move action tweaks configs + converter
- console command to start autorotation
- worldstate: animlock, combo, gauge parser
- action transforms?..
- Autorotation.cs
-- not tied to game - convert to rotationmodulemanager basically
-- manage ui and active modules
- CommonActions.cs
-- just a base class for rotation modules
-- move rotation expire logic to autorotation?
--- maybe need to split into manager + manual layers?


autorotation rework:
- priority action suggestions
- control panel w/ presets and bindings
- module registry supporting alternatives per job
- unify lb planning across all classes
- proper gcd time calculations
- simulation in replay analysis
- cooldowns
-- get rid of cdgroup enums

general:
- refactor window system to dispose stuff properly and avoid CS1806 and `_ = new...` pattern
- diagnostic to detect readonly mutable collections
- introduce 'Game' class that would contain dalamud services and stuff like AMEx/IDScramble, instead of statics, to avoid uncontrolled access to game state (won't help with CS tho)
- autoreplay improvements - react to module manager transitions?
- better timing tracking for: statuses, gauges, cooldowns, cast times, anim lock, ...
- constrain bossmodules to zone id (e.g. for T04)
- revise module categories - consider merging fates/hunts/quests/gold saucer?/pvp? into outdoor?/casual?
- refactor pendingeffects
- utility to inject custom ipcs to the stream for debugging?

boss modules:
- wipe should not fast forward all phases
- fail log
- boss module config presets/profiles

autorotation:
- dot/regen server tick tracking
- brd
-- aoe rotation (2/3/4+ targets, barrage usage)
-- take traits into account (ij proccing rs, ea proccing repertoire)
- drg
-- priorities...
-- dragon sight is a true north
-- cd planning
- war
-- simulate gauge changes (message can arrive few frames after ActionEffect...)
-- low-level rotation - improve berserk delay logic
- whm:
-- resurrect (6.1 and later changes)
-- planner
-- smart-targeting for ST actions

cooldown planner:
- in-combat cooldown plan ui
- select columns to show (concrete actions, categories)

ai:
- improve healing AI: analyze incoming dps
- movement: know time left, distance to travel => decide whether to swiftcast or slidecast or use movement rotation

world rendering:
- danger zones (modify action vfx?)
- arrows

replay encounter analysis:
- tether & debuff passing range
- pull range

misc:
- memory show/watch utility
- clip circles to arena bounds...
- draw target max-melee and boss positioning hints?..
- assignments/config sharing (webservice?)

notes on targeting:
- aoe (e.g. cone) will hit if shape intersects target's hitbox; for players it is == 0.5
- max melee range is raw range (usually 3) + source hitbox radius + target hitbox radius; for players this usually means 3.5 + target hitbox
- charge/onslaught will bring player to source hitbox radius + target hitbox radius range, or leave in place if current distance is less
