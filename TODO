general:
- show safe/unsafe marker
- draw danger zones in world
- detect stuff like zodiark snakes, etc - look at graphics scene or maybe network messages...
- memory show/watch utility
- clip circles to arena bounds...

boss modules:
- data driven => would enable sequence autorecord and live editing
- p1s
-- intemperance order (??)
- p2s
- zodiark
-- refactor
- hydaelyn, p3s, p4s: todo

autorotation:
- improve rotation logic
- autodetect raidbuffs
- integrate with bossmodules and enable/disable movement
- defensive cooldowns (offensive veng, integrate with bossmodules - CD planner)
- generalize to other classes
- aoe rotation, maybe even auto-detect targets and autoselect st/aoe...
