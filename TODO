general:
- memory show/watch utility
- clip circles to arena bounds...
- reconsider worldstate->bossmodule event subscription model (tedious to manually subscribe/unsubsribe and forward to components...)
- fail log?

network:
- hook send/recv (a-la xivalexander)
- store raw packets, create visualizer
- auto detect new opcodes for known packets based on size
- allow injecting custom client messages in next sent bundle (or just create new bundle?..)

boss modules:
- refactor party (always 8 players) + optional alliance?, support open-world encounters...
- refactor state machine (add id/comment, better bosscast states, remove timeouts)
- p1s - make intemperance component useful
- p2s - improve channeling flow component
- p2s - coherence hints are shit
- p2s - minor components (shockwave, ominous bubbling, eruption?..)
- zodiark - refactor
- hydaelyn - todo
- improve per-player risks...
- data driven => would enable sequence autorecord and live editing

autorotation:
- planner (defensive CDs, charge, delay offensive?)
- war: offensive veng
- war: aoe rotation, maybe even auto-detect targets and autoselect st/aoe...
- whm:
-- dia/glare -> downscale lvl; select based on debuff
-- holy: manual
-- assize, pom: manual?
-- st gcd heal: affsolace -> cure2 (no lilies) -> cure (lvl/mana)
-- aoe gcd heal: affrapture -> medica2 (no lilies) -> cure3 (buff up/not nearby) -> medica (lvl/mana/not stacked)
-- st ogcd heal: tetra, db, bene (manual)
-- asylum: manual
-- regen: manual
-- pi/temperance: manual
-- affmisery: manual (needed to cover movement)
-- swiftcast: manual
-- lucid dreaming, thin air: ???
-- surecast: manual (or planned for kb)
- action not learned = GetActionStatus -> 573 (this is rowid of LogMessage "action not yet learned")

world rendering:
- danger zones (modify action vfx?)
- arrows
