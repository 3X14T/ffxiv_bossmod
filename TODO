replay encounter analysis:
- aoe shape

network:
- hook send/recv (a-la xivalexander)
- store raw packets, create visualizer
- auto detect new opcodes for known packets based on size
- allow injecting custom client messages in next sent bundle (or just create new bundle?..)

boss modules:
- draw actors by framework (components should return color+prio)
- assignments and sharing (webservice?)
- p1s - get enrage log
- p3s - review, searing breeze component

autorotation:
- planner (defensive CDs, charge, delay offensive?)
- war: offensive veng
- war: aoe rotation, maybe even auto-detect targets and autoselect st/aoe...
- whm:
-- dia/glare -> downscale lvl; select based on debuff
-- holy: manual
-- assize, pom: manual?
-- st gcd heal: affsolace -> cure2 (no lilies) -> cure (lvl/mana)
-- aoe gcd heal: affrapture -> medica2 (no lilies) -> cure3 (buff up/not nearby) -> medica (lvl/mana/not stacked)
-- st ogcd heal: tetra, db, bene (manual)
-- asylum: manual
-- regen: manual
-- pi/temperance: manual
-- affmisery: manual (needed to cover movement)
-- swiftcast: manual
-- lucid dreaming, thin air: ???
-- surecast: manual (or planned for kb)
- action not learned = GetActionStatus -> 573 (this is rowid of LogMessage "action not yet learned")

world rendering:
- danger zones (modify action vfx?)
- arrows

misc:
- memory show/watch utility
- clip circles to arena bounds...
- reconsider worldstate->bossmodule event subscription model (tedious to manually subscribe/unsubsribe and forward to components...)
- fail log?
- determine exact mechanism for cooldown reset (on instance enter and on wipe)
- data driven boss modules?.. would enable sequence autorecord and live editing - or is it covered by replay analysis?
- draw target max-melee and boss positioning hints?..
