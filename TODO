general:
- memory show/watch utility
- clip circles to arena bounds...
- reconsider worldstate->bossmodule event subscription model (tedious to manually subscribe/unsubsribe and forward to components...)
- fail log?

network:
- hook send/recv (a-la xivalexander)
- store raw packets, create visualizer
- auto detect new opcodes for known packets based on size
- allow injecting custom client messages in next sent bundle (or just create new bundle?..)

boss modules:
- refactor components (base class component list should only contain active components)
- remove all remaining timeouts
- p1s - make intemperance component useful
- p2s - improve channeling flow component
- p2s - minor components (shockwave, ominous bubbling, eruption?..)
- zodiark - refactor
- hydaelyn - todo
- improve per-player risks...
- data driven => would enable sequence autorecord and live editing

autorotation:
- improve rotation logic
- autodetect raidbuffs
- integrate with bossmodules and enable/disable movement
- defensive cooldowns (offensive veng, integrate with bossmodules - CD planner)
- generalize to other classes
- aoe rotation, maybe even auto-detect targets and autoselect st/aoe...

world rendering:
- danger zones
- arrows
